# Fundamentals of Agro-Environmental Data Science

# Exercise 6 - Create your data sources catalogue

This is an exploratory exercise, which should contribute to your portfolio of tools
for Data Science.

## Introduction

The availability of data online is increasing every day. This can be in the form of:
- structured data available for download by humans
- structured data available for access through an API, for "machines" (applications)
- semi-structured data, not available for easy download, but that can be crawled with
an application
- other forms, not structured

In this exercise we will explore the sources of available data online. We will practice:
- to identify data sources
- to identify if data is available in a structured format
- to verify if and which data licence was assigned to data
- compile information and references about the datasets that fit best your interests

## 1. Search for data in online data catalogues

Data catalogues are online aggregator platforms that use the **metadata** of 
datasets to index them, facilitating search of data by users. This reveals 
the importance of creating good metadata documentation that can facilitate 
the discovery of data by interested users.

In this task you should explore the online data catalogues to identify datasets that 
can be relevant for your future work in Data Science, and, in particular, the 
domain of interest (and problem) that you identified in your **Assignment** exercise.

To search for available datasets, you can use any online data catalogue, including the list discussed in the class:
- United Nations - UNDATA - http://data.un.org/ 
- UN partner organisations: http://data.un.org/Partners.aspx 
- FAO (several databases) - https://www.fao.org/statistics/databases/en/ 
- FAOSTAT - https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data 
- Copernicus Open Access Hub - Satellite data - https://scihub.copernicus.eu/ 
- European data - https://data.europa.eu/en 
- US Open Data - https://data.gov/
- Dados abertos da administração pública - Portugal - https://dados.gov.pt/pt/
- Data Portals - http://datacatalogs.org/
- Kaggle - online community - find and publish data sets - https://www.kaggle.com/   
- Google Data Search - https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/ 

To organise your catalogue, you can use any tool (e.g. your bibliographic data manager like Zotero, EndNote Web, Mendeley), a table or a text document in Markdown format or any other format. However, for each dataset of interest you identify, you should get the following information:
- title
- topic/domain
- data provider
- URL
- licence
- data download format
- existence of an API
- number of stars in the 5 Star Open Data classification

If possible, verify that you can download the data. That will help to verify 
the level of data openness (the number of stars).

This catalogue will be open for future additions, but, at this stage, you should
identify at least ten datasets that you consider important for your domain of 
interest.

## Wrap up
In this exercise, you learned about finding data sources/datasets online:
- dataset catalogues
- dataset search tools
- dataset documentation
- data formats
- data access
